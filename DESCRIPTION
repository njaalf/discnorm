Description: Tests whether multivariate ordinal data may stem from discretizing a multivariate normal distribution.
             The test is described by Foldnes and Grønneberg (2019) <doi:10.1080/10705511.2019.1673168>. 
             In addition, an adjusted polychoric correlation estimator is provided that takes marginal knowledge into account,
             as described by Grønneberg and Foldnes (2022) <doi: https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000495>.
